## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Neon PostgreSQL database
- Cloudflare R2 bucket (optional for file uploads)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Configure your environment variables in `.env.local`:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-database-url"
DIRECT_URL="your-neon-direct-url"

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Cloudflare R2 Configuration (optional)
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME="your-bucket-name"
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ENDPOINT="your-r2-endpoint"
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## Design System

The platform uses a custom glassmorphism design system with healthcare-focused colors:

- **Medical Blue** (`#0066CC`): Primary actions and navigation
- **Medical Green** (`#00A86B`): Success states and approvals
- **Medical Amber** (`#F59E0B`): Warnings and alerts
- **Medical Red** (`#DC2626`): Critical alerts and errors

### Glass Components

- `GlassCard`: Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur
- `GlassButton`: Interactive buttons with glass effects
- `GlassInput`: Form inputs with glass styling

## Development Workflow

This project follows a spec-driven development approach. Feature specifications are located in `.kiro/specs/compliance-management-platform/`:

- `requirements.md`: Feature requirements in EARS format
- `design.md`: Technical design and architecture
- `tasks.md`: Implementation task list

## Database Schema

The application uses an existing PostgreSQL schema (`v_1_init_schema.sql`) with the following key tables:

- `TaiKhoan`: User accounts and authentication
- `NhanVien`: Healthcare practitioner records
- `GhiNhanHoatDong`: Activity submissions and approvals
- `DonVi`: Healthcare units and organizational structure
- `NhatKyHeThong`: Comprehensive audit logging for all system operations

## Audit Logging System

The platform includes a comprehensive audit logging system that tracks:

- All data modifications (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE operations)
- User authentication events (login/logout)
- File upload and download operations
- Activity approvals and rejections
- Data export and import operations

**Key Features:**
- Role-based access (SoYTe and Auditor roles only)
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Record history tracking with before/after values
- File integrity verification with SHA-256 checksums
- CSV export for external analysis
- System-wide statistics and suspicious activity detection

**Documentation:** See `docs/audit-system.md` for detailed usage and API documentation.

**Access:** Navigate to `/audit` (requires SoYTe or Auditor role)

## Contributing

1. Review the feature specifications in `.kiro/specs/`
2. Follow the task-based implementation approach
3. Ensure all components follow the glassmorphism design system
4. Test with different user roles and permissions
