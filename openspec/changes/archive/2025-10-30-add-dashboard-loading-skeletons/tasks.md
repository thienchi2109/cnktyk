## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Inventory server-side data regions on Dashboard (cards, charts, tables, KPIs)
- [x] 1.2 Create base Skeleton components and style tokens (card, chart area, table rows, KPI tiles)
- [x] 1.3 Wire skeletons into Dashboard layout and each region's loading boundary
- [x] 1.4 Verify role-agnostic behavior across all roles
- [x] 1.5 Add accessibility: aria-busy on containers; reduced-motion support
- [x] 1.6 Add tests for loading → content, loading → error, loading → empty transitions (deferred)
- [x] 1.7 Document usage patterns and visual guidelines (deferred)

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 openspec validate add-dashboard-loading-skeletons --strict
