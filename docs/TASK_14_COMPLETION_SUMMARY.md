---

## Deliverables

### 1. API Endpoints

#### `/api/system/metrics` (GET)
**File**: `src/app/api/system/metrics/route.ts`

**Purpose**: Provides system-wide KPI metrics for executive overview

**Access Control**: SoYTe role only

**Metrics Returned**:

- `atRiskPractitioners`: Practitioners < 70% progress with < 6 months remaining

**Key Calculations**:
```sql
-- Compliance Rate
(Compliant Practitioners / Active Practitioners) × 100

-- At-Risk Identification
< 70% of required credits AND < 6 months until cycle end
```

### 2. Dashboard Component

**File**: `src/components/dashboard/doh-dashboard.tsx`

#### Executive KPI Cards (5 Metrics)

1. **Total Units**
   - Icon: Building2 (blue)
   - Shows active units count
   - Label: "Đang hoạt động"

2. **Active Practitioners**
   - Icon: Users (blue)
   - Shows working practitioners
   - Label: "Đang làm việc"

3. **System Compliance Rate**
   - Icon: CheckCircle (green)
   - Shows percentage
   - Label: "Tỷ lệ hoàn thành"

4. **Pending Approvals**
   - Icon: Clock (amber)
   - Shows activities awaiting review
   - Label: "Hoạt động"

5. **At-Risk Practitioners**
   - Icon: AlertTriangle (red)
   - Shows practitioners needing attention
   - Label: "Cần theo dõi"

#### System Analytics Section

**Features**:
- Collapsible section with ChevronUp/Down toggle
- Three-column grid layout (responsive)

**Column 1: Monthly Activity**
- Approved count (green background)
- Rejected count (red background)
- Total submissions (blue background)

**Column 2: Credits**
- Total credits awarded
- Award icon with gradient background
- Formatted with locale-specific number display

**Column 3: Performance Metrics**
- Approval rate percentage
- Average credits per practitioner
- Calculated dynamically from metrics

#### Multi-Unit Comparison Grid

**Search & Sort Controls**:
- Text search input (filters by unit name)
- Three sort buttons:
  - By Name (alphabetical)
  - By Compliance (highest first)
  - By Practitioners (most first)
- Active sort button highlighted

**Unit Cards**:
- Color-coded border based on compliance:
  - Green: ≥ 90% (compliant)
  - Amber: 70-89% (at-risk)
  - Red: < 70% (critical)
- Large compliance percentage display
- Unit name and type
- Four metrics per card:
  - Active practitioners
  - Compliant practitioners (green)
  - Pending approvals (amber)
  - Total credits (blue)
- "Xem chi tiết" button (View details)

**Responsive Grid**:
- 1 column on mobile
- 2 columns on tablet
- 3 columns on desktop

**Loading & Empty States**:
- Spinner animation while loading
- Empty state with Building2 icon
- "Không tìm thấy đơn vị" message

---

### 3. Page Route

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/doh/page.tsx`

**Route**: `/dashboard/doh`

**Access Control**:
- Requires authentication (redirects to `/auth/signin`)
- Requires SoYTe role (redirects to `/dashboard`)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
- Uses requireAuth() from @/lib/auth/server
- Checks session.user.role === 'SoYTe'
- Passes userId to DohDashboard component
```

---

### 4. Dashboard Routing Update

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Updated Routing Logic**:
```typescript
if (user.role === 'SoYTe') {
  redirect('/dashboard/doh');
}
if (user.role === 'NguoiHanhNghe') {
  redirect('/dashboard/practitioner');
}
if (user.role === 'DonVi') {
  redirect('/dashboard/unit-admin');
}
// Auditor falls through to generic dashboard
```

## Design System Compliance

### Glassmorphism UI
- ✅ GlassCard components throughout
- ✅ GlassButton for actions
- ✅ Semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur
- ✅ Smooth transitions and animations

### Healthcare Color Palette
- ✅ `medical-blue`: Primary actions, units
- ✅ `medical-green`: Success, compliance
- ✅ `medical-amber`: Warnings, pending
- ✅ `medical-red`: Alerts, critical

### Responsive Design
- ✅ Mobile-first approach
- ✅ Collapsible sections for small screens
- ✅ Touch-friendly controls
- ✅ Responsive grid layouts
- ✅ useIsDesktop() hook integration

### Vietnamese Localization
- ✅ All UI text in Vietnamese
- ✅ Proper diacritics
- ✅ Healthcare-specific terminology
- ✅ Number formatting with locale

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries

**Complexity**: High
- Multiple complex aggregations
- JOINs across 4 tables (DonVi, NhanVien, KyCNKT, GhiNhanHoatDong)
- Subqueries for credit calculations
- Date range filtering with `date_trunc`
- COALESCE for null handling

**Performance Considerations**:
- Parallel query execution with Promise.all()
- Indexed columns used in WHERE clauses
- Efficient GROUP BY operations
- COUNT DISTINCT for accurate counts

### State Management

**React Hooks Used**:
- `useState`: metrics, units, loading, searchTerm, sortBy, expandedSections
- `useEffect`: Data fetching on mount
- `useIsDesktop`: Responsive behavior

**State Updates**:
- Separate loading states for metrics and units
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error handling with console.error

### TypeScript

**Type Safety**:
- Interface definitions for SystemMetrics, UnitPerformance
- Generic typing for database queries
- Type assertions for query results (as any)
- Proper typing for event handlers

**Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface SystemMetrics {
  totalUnits: number;
  totalPractitioners: number;
  activePractitioners: number;
  complianceRate: number;
  totalSubmissions: number;
  pendingApprovals: number;
  approvedThisMonth: number;
  rejectedThisMonth: number;
  totalCreditsAwarded: number;
  atRiskPractitioners: number;
}

interface UnitPerformance {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: string;
  totalPractitioners: number;
  activePractitioners: number;
  compliantPractitioners: number;
  complianceRate: number;
  pendingApprovals: number;
  totalCredits: number;
}
```

---

## Key Metrics & Calculations

### 1. System Compliance Rate
```
(Compliant Practitioners / Active Practitioners) × 100

Where Compliant = earned credits ≥ required credits in current cycle
```

### 2. At-Risk Practitioners
```
Criteria:
- Current cycle status = 'DangDienRa'
- Cycle end date ≤ 6 months from now
- Earned credits < (Required credits × 0.7)
```

### 3. Approval Rate
```
(Approved This Month / Total Submissions) × 100
```

### 4. Average Credits Per Practitioner
```
Total Credits Awarded / Active Practitioners
```

### 5. Unit Compliance Rate
```
(Compliant Practitioners in Unit / Active Practitioners in Unit) × 100
```
