**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: Practitioners management UI/UX improvements

## 🎯 Objective

Refactor the practitioners page to use modern off-canvas sheets for all CRUD operations, eliminate page navigation, and implement consistent floating action button (FAB) patterns throughout the interface.

- Compact 2-column metrics layout

---

### 4. **Floating Action Button (FAB) Pattern**

**Implementation:**

#### **Form Actions in Sheets:**
```tsx
<div className="fixed bottom-6 right-6 flex gap-3 z-50">
  <Button variant="outline" className="rounded-full shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl bg-white">
    <X className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
    Hủy
  </Button>
  <Button className="rounded-full shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl">
    <Save className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
    Cập nhật
  </Button>
</div>
```

#### **Header Trigger Buttons:**
```tsx
<Button className="rounded-full shadow-sm hover:shadow-md">
  <Plus className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
  Thêm người hành nghề
</Button>
```

**Styling Consistency:**
- All buttons: `rounded-full` shape
- Header buttons: `shadow-sm hover:shadow-md`
- Floating buttons: `shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl`
- Smooth shadow transitions
- Proper z-index layering

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before & After Comparison

#### **Create Flow:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Click "Add" → Navigate to `/new` | Click "Add" → Sheet slides in |
| Full page form | Off-canvas sheet |
| Submit → Navigate back | Submit → Sheet closes, list refreshes |
| **3 page loads** | **0 page loads** |

#### **Edit Flow:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Click "Edit" → Navigate to `/edit` | Click "View" → Sheet slides in |
| Full page form | Click "Edit" → Form in same sheet |
| Submit → Navigate back | Submit → Return to view mode |
| **3 page loads** | **0 page loads** |

#### **Import Flow:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Click "Import" → Navigate to `/import` | Click "Import" → Sheet slides in |
| Full page workflow | Complete workflow in sheet |
| Complete → Navigate back | Complete → Sheet closes, list refreshes |
| **2 page loads** | **0 page loads** |

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Page Navigation Eliminated
- **Before**: 8 page loads for full CRUD cycle (list → create → list → view → edit → list → import → list)
- **After**: 1 page load for full CRUD cycle (list only)
- **Improvement**: 87.5% reduction in page navigation

### User Experience
- ✅ Instant feedback (no loading states between pages)
- ✅ Context preservation (background list always visible)
- ✅ Smooth animations (sheet transitions)
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load (stay in one view)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### PractitionerForm - Dual Mode Support

**Card Variant** (Standalone pages):
```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>...</CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    {formContent}
    {formActions} // Traditional inline buttons
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

**Sheet Variant** (Off-canvas):
```tsx
<>
  {formContent}
  {floatingActions} // FAB at bottom-right
</>
```

### State Management
- Sheet open/close state controlled by parent
- Auto-reset on close
- Success callbacks trigger list refresh
- Form state preserved during edit mode toggle

### Responsive Design
- Sheets: `w-full sm:max-w-3xl` (forms) or `sm:max-w-2xl` (import)
- Floating buttons: Always visible with high z-index
- Mobile-friendly: Large touch targets (size="lg")
