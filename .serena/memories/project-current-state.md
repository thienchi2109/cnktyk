GET: Retrieve user details with permission checks
PUT: Update user information with role-based restrictions
DELETE: Soft delete (deactivate) users
/api/users/profile - User profile management
GET: Current user's profile with unit information
PUT: Self-service profile updates (password changes)

🚀 Ready for Production
The user management system is now fully functional and ready for use. It provides:

Complete CRUD operations for user accounts
Secure role-based access control
Professional healthcare-themed UI
Vietnamese language support
Mobile-responsive design
Integration with existing authentication system
The implementation follows all established patterns and maintains consistency with the existing codebase while providing essential user management capabilities for the CNKTYKLT compliance platform.
