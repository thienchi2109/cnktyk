# Task 14: Department of Health Dashboard - COMPLETE

## Overview
Executive dashboard for Department of Health (SoYTe) role with system-wide monitoring and multi-unit comparison capabilities.

## Components Created

- **Access**: SoYTe role only
- **Returns**:
  - Total units, practitioners, submissions
  - System-wide compliance rate
  - Pending approvals count
  - Monthly approval/rejection statistics
  - Total credits awarded
  - At-risk practitioners count

#### `/api/system/units-performance` (GET)
- **Purpose**: Performance metrics for all units
- **Access**: SoYTe role only
- **Returns**: Array of unit performance data
  - Unit ID, name, type
  - Practitioner counts (total, active, compliant)
  - Compliance rate per unit
  - Pending approvals per unit
  - Total credits per unit

### 2. Dashboard Component

**File**: `src/components/dashboard/doh-dashboard.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Executive KPI Cards** (5 metrics)
  - Total units
  - Active practitioners
  - System compliance rate
  - Pending approvals
  - At-risk practitioners

- **System Analytics Section**
  - Monthly activity statistics (approved/rejected/total)
  - Total credits awarded
  - Performance metrics (approval rate, average credits per practitioner)
  - Collapsible section for mobile

- **Multi-Unit Comparison Grid**
  - Search functionality
  - Sort options (name, compliance, practitioners)
  - Color-coded compliance indicators (green/amber/red)
  - Unit cards showing:
    - Compliance percentage
    - Practitioner counts
    - Pending approvals
    - Total credits
  - "View details" button per unit
  - Collapsible section for mobile

**Design**:
- Glassmorphism UI consistent with app design language
- Healthcare color palette (medical-blue, medical-green, medical-amber, medical-red)
- Responsive grid layouts
- Mobile-optimized with collapsible sections

### 3. Page Route

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/doh/page.tsx`
- Route: `/dashboard/doh`
- Access control: SoYTe role only
- Auto-redirect non-SoYTe users to `/dashboard`

### 4. Dashboard Routing Update

**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Added SoYTe redirect to `/dashboard/doh`
- Routing hierarchy:
  - SoYTe → `/dashboard/doh`
  - NguoiHanhNghe → `/dashboard/practitioner`
  - DonVi → `/dashboard/unit-admin`
  - Auditor → Generic dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries
- Complex aggregation queries with JOINs
- Compliance calculation based on active cycles
- At-risk identification (< 70% progress, < 6 months remaining)
- Monthly statistics using `date_trunc`
- Proper use of COALESCE for null handling

### State Management
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Separate loading states for metrics and units
- Search and sort state management
- Collapsible sections state

### TypeScript
- Proper interface definitions
- Type-safe API responses
- Generic typing for database queries

## Key Metrics Calculated

1. **Compliance Rate**: (Compliant practitioners / Active practitioners) × 100
   - Compliant = earned credits ≥ required credits in current cycle

2. **At-Risk Practitioners**: Count of practitioners with:
   - < 70% of required credits
   - < 6 months until cycle end

3. **Approval Rate**: (Approved this month / Total submissions) × 100

4. **Average Credits**: Total credits awarded / Active practitioners

## Vietnamese Localization
- All UI text in Vietnamese
- Proper diacritics and terminology
- Healthcare-specific vocabulary

## Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
- ✅ All diagnostics passed
- ✅ Production ready

## Next Steps
- Task 15: Reporting & Export functionality
- Consider adding:
  - Real-time activity feed
  - Trend charts (compliance over time)
  - Export to Excel/PDF
  - Drill-down to unit details
  - Predictive analytics
