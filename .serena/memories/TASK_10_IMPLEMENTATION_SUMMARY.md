## üé® Design Features

### Glassmorphism UI
- All components use glass effects (backdrop-blur, transparency)
- Healthcare color palette (medical-blue, medical-green, medical-amber, medical-red)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

### Vietnamese Localization
- All UI text in Vietnamese
- Date formatting in Vietnamese locale
- Healthcare terminology properly translated

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color-coded status with icons (not color-only)
- High contrast text on glass backgrounds

## üîí Security & Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control
- **NguoiHanhNghe (Practitioners)**: View own cycle and credits only
- **DonVi (Unit Admins)**: View practitioners in their unit
- **SoYTe (Department of Health)**: Full access to all data and rule management
- **Auditor**: Read-only access to all compliance data

### Data Validation
- Zod schemas for all API inputs
- Server-side validation for credit calculations
- Category limit enforcement
- Date range validation for credit rules

### Audit Trail
- All credit rule changes logged to NhatKyHeThong
- User ID, timestamp, action, and changes recorded
- Immutable audit log for compliance

## üìä Database Integration

### Tables Used
- **QuyTacTinChi**: Credit rules with requirements and category limits
- **GhiNhanHoatDong**: Activity records with calculated credits
- **NhanVien**: Practitioner information with cycle start dates
- **DanhMucHoatDong**: Activity catalog with conversion rates
- **NhatKyHeThong**: Audit log for all changes

### Queries Optimized
- Indexed queries for practitioner ID and date ranges
- Aggregation queries for credit summaries
- Efficient JOIN operations for activity type grouping
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### Efficient Calculations
- Credit calculations performed at submission time
- Cached cycle information in component state
- Batch statistics calculations for dashboards
- Minimal database queries with proper indexing

### Loading States
- Skeleton components during data fetch
